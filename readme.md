THE BASICS OF PYTHON PROGRAMMING

This project comprises of several python programs based on given instructions. To view these instructions, read the file 'project_description.pdf' in the python_1 repository.

Prerequisities:

  - Python 3.0 or newer
  - Must have exturtle.py (provided in repository) in same directory while running some of the programs; there are       dependencies between certain programs (ring.py cannot run without the exturtle.py module in the same directory).

Acknowledgments:

I would like to acknowledge the University of Exeter for providing me with the project instructions, and the pre-written exturtle.py program.
